# Book Recommender

## Problem Statement
Book Recommender System:

Create a web application where users can input a book they like and receive recommendations for similar books.

### Requirements:

Model: Use collaborative filtering or content-based recommendation models or a hybrid.

### Data Source:

[Goodreads dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks): Contains information about various books including ratings.
Alternatively, use the [Book-Crossings](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/) dataset.

### Training:

For collaborative filtering, use user-item interactions to determine the similarity between users or items.
For content-based recommendations, analyze book descriptions, genres, authors, etc., to recommend similar content.

### Back-end: API for Recommendations

Requirements:

Framework: Consider using Flask or FastAPI for Python.

Endpoints:

1. POST /recommend: Accepts a book title as input and returns a list of recommended books.
2. GET /books: Returns a list of all available books for selection.
Database: Store book information and user interactions.
Consider using SQL databases like PostgreSQL or NoSQL databases like MongoDB depending on scalability needs.

### Front-end: User Interface for Recommendations

Requirements:

Framework: React.js or Vue.js are popular choices.

Components:

Search Bar: For users to input their favorite book.

Results Area: Display the list of recommended books.

Book List: Display a list of popular books or all available books for users to choose from.

Interaction:

Users input/select a book, the front-end sends a request to the back-end, and displays the recommendations when they are received.

Steps to Execute:

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing: Start with the Goodreads or Book-Crossings dataset. Preprocess the data to handle missing values and derive meaningful features.
2. ML Model Development: Train the recommendation system. Evaluate its performance, refine, and once satisfied, serialize the model for deployment.
3. Back-end Development: Set up the back-end framework. Create the database schema, develop the required endpoints, and integrate the ML model.
4. Front-end Development: Create a simple web interface where users can input or select a book and see the recommended books. Ensure it communicates effectively with the back-end.
5. Deployment & Monitoring: Deploy the whole solution (front-end, back-end, and ML model) on a server/cloud. Monitor for any issues and gather user feedback for future refinements.
6. This project will allow you to cover several areas, including data preprocessing, machine learning modeling, API development, database handling, front-end development, and deployment. Good luck
